                   We kindly welcome to Dance studio ,Dance and rock ..!
                   We at Mercury believe in the importance of a stylistically well-rounded dance program with emphasis on a strong technical base. Self-motivation strategies are implemented in our classes for instructors to achieve desired outcomes and students to achieve their goals. Our experience has taught us the discipline and skills learned in studio will not only provide our students with future opportunities in dance, but give them the tools to be successful in life.

      She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
      I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
      Who will dance on the floor in the round?
      She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
      She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
      Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
      Who will dance on the floor in the round
      People always told me be careful of what you do
      And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
      And mother always told me be careful of who you love
      And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
      Billie Jean is not my lover
      She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
      But the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
      For forty days and forty nights
      The law was on her side
      But who can stand when she's in demand
      Her schemes and plans
      'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
      So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
      (Do think twice, do think twice)
      She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
      Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
      'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
      People always told me be careful of what you do
      And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
      She came and stood right by me
      Just the smell of sweet perfume
      This happened much too soon
      She called me to her room
